# Micro Proccessor Game Project 
this is an old  project for a basic game on a stm32 micro controller 
it would use the screen on the circuit board to draw characaters to the screen and on each system tick 

it worked off of 4 directional buttons that would allow the user to move a small character around the screen
- the character would collect small coins to increase the users score
- at the same time an npc (non player character) would move around at random with collision detection so it wont hit a go through the edge of the screen 
- at any point of the user touches off of the npc it will remove one of the lives from the the user
